## Hi there, Im Ginwoo ðŸ‘‹

### Contact me: [![Linkedin: LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white&link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/caleb-kim0510/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginwoopak/)

I always thought my dream was to be an astronaut. 

It seemed like an appropriate dream given my BS in Mechanical Engineering. A couple of coding classes (MatLab, Python) in college peaked my interest in software development but I thought it was too late to switch majors. After graduating from UCSB, I started my career as a Consultant Engineer and had so much fun learning and working in diverse occupations and engineering solutions for property risk improvement. I was so fortunate to have worked at FM Global as my first job but something was missing. After a few years, I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different. 

Then, the pandemic hit and my perspective shifted from "What should I be doing?" to "What do I actually want to do?". 

I realized I wanted to turn my passion for software development into a productive skill, and decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I completed Hack Reactor, an intensive 1000+ hour immersive software engineering program that solidified my understanding of JavaScript and full-stack development. As I continue to grow as a developer, I hope to use my skills on projects that support sustainability and inclusiveness.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking Korean, Thai, and Japanese recipes I find on youtube and lounging around with my three dogs and two cats! Feel free to DM me about software, Youtube recipe channel recommendations, or otherwise. Would love to connect!
